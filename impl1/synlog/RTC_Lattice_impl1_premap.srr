@W: MT529 :"e:\dev\rtc_lattice\hdl\piffla.vhd":31:4:31:5|Found inferred clock pif_flasher|xclk_inferred_clock which controls 35 sequential elements including F.TBLOCK\.TK.Ctr[18:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.

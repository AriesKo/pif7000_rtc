@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\dev\pif7000_rtc\hdl\piffla.vhd":31:4:31:5|Found inferred clock pif_flasher|xclk_inferred_clock which controls 61 sequential elements including F.TBLOCK\.TK.Ctr[18:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.

@W: BN132 :"e:\dev\rtc_lattice\hdl\lock.vhd":188:1:188:2|Removing sequential instance comp_ADPLL_RTC_CORE.ADPLL_CORE_Label.u7.CLK_REF_FE_D2 because it is equivalent to instance comp_ADPLL_RTC_CORE.ADPLL_CORE_Label.u7.CLK_REF_FE_2. To keep the instance, apply constraint syn_preserve=1 on the instance.

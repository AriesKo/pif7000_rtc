WARNING - par: The JTAG Port has been disabled in this project, and JTAG pins will be configured as General Purpose IO. You must use JTAGENB pin in hardware to change the personality of the port from JTAG pins to general purpose IO. This mux control pin is dedicated to the selection of JTAG pins for GPIO use by the user design.  Refer to the MachXO2 Handbook for details on dual-function JTAG ports.
WARNING - par: The SN pin is not available for use as a general purpose I/O pin when the SLAVE_SPI_PORT attribute is enabled.  The SN pin should be tied high with an external pull-up if you are not using the Slave SPI port for configuration.

Pin Constraint Summary:
   6 out of 6 pins locked (100% locked).

The following 1 signal is selected to use the primary clock routing resources:
    R4_c (driver: F/OSCInst0, clk load #: 21)


The following 1 signal is selected to use the secondary clock routing resources:
    F/Tick (driver: F/TBLOCK.TK/SLICE_1, clk load #: 0, sr load #: 14, ce load #: 4)

Signal GSRnX is selected as Global Set/Reset.

*****************************************************************
Info: NBR allows conflicts(one node used by more than one signal)
      in the earlier iterations. In each iteration, it tries to  
      solve the conflicts while keeping the critical connections 
      routed as short as possible. The routing process is said to
      be completed when no conflicts exist and all connections   
      are routed.                                                
Note: NBR uses a different method to calculate timing slacks. The
      worst slack and total negative slack may not be the same as
      that in TRCE report. You should always run TRCE to verify  
      your design.
